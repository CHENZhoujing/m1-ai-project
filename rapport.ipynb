    "The n-sliding puzzle is a puzzle that consists of a grid of numbered tiles with one empty space. The object of the puzzle is to rearrange the tiles by sliding them into the empty space. The tiles can only be moved if they are adjacent to the empty space. For example, in a 4x4 puzzle, the tiles that are adjacent to the empty space can be moved into the empty space, but the tiles that are diagonal to the empty space cannot be moved. To solve the puzzle, the player must slide the tiles around until they are in the correct order. The size of the puzzle is determined by the value of \"n\", with a larger value of n resulting in a larger puzzle with more tiles. We specify 0 as the empty space.\n",
    "\n",
    "STATES: A state in the puzzle will represent a particular configuration of the tiles. For example, in the 15-sliding puzzle, a state could be the arrangement of the tiles shown below:\n",

    "9 10 11 12\n",

    "\n",
    "ACTIONS: The actions available in this problem will be the movement of a tile into the empty space. For example, if the empty space is in the bottom right corner, you could move the tile in the bottom left corner into the empty space.\n",
    "\n",
    "GOAL TEST: The goal of the puzzle is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in the correct order, with the empty space in the bottom right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "PATH COST: The cost of a path in this problem will be the number of moves required to reach the goal state from the current state. For example, if it takes 5 moves to reach the goal state from the current state, the cost of the path would be 5.\n",
